# laravel-react-fullstack-app

This is a fullstack web app I am making for one of my classes.

The current idea for the application is to create a real time group chat application.

It's important to note that when running the application through `docker compose` you will need to disable `CORS`.

Tech stack:
- Docker - Used for easier installation
- React - Used to build the frontend
- PHP (Laravel) - Used to build the backend
