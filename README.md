# laravel-react-fullstack-app

This is a fullstack web app I am making for one of my classes.

The current idea for the application is to create a real time group chat application.

Tech stack:
- Docker - Used for easier installation
- React - Used to build the frontend
- PHP (Laravel) - Used to build the backend
