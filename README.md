# drogon-react-fullstack-app

This is a fullstack web app I am making for one of my classes.

The idea is to create a website for a band to host their upcomming events as well as their music and their about page. The app should also have a CMS for managing the content.

Tech stack:
- Drogon - Used to build the backend
- React - Used to build the frontend
