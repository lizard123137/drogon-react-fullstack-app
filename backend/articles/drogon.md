# Drogon Blog

It all started in one of my classes, where we were supposed to build a web application.

Luckily we have the freedom to pick whatever framework we want to use. Last year on a similar subject I built a website using `Rust Dioxus` it was quite challenging, but at least it wasn't boring.

This year I decided on `Drogon` and `React`, both of which I have little experience with...

`Drogon` is pretty cool, because it's in `c++` and `React` is... well it's useful to know and maybe with some hands on experience I'll come around to it.

The goal of the project it to have a backend that can supply the frontend with articles that are stored on the server as `markdown` files. The frontend will then parse them and render them.

I know that using files on the server is a hack, but I'm trying to avoid using a database and it's not really a problem, since there won't be that many articles.
